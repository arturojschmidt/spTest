Last Tested on a macOS Mojave system on November 13, 2019 by Elise Dixon. 

# Testing

How can the user run the test suite? Give specific commands.
Any other test-related commands to know about, e.g. a different command for unit tests vs. integration tests?

# Deployment

Where does the production system live? How would a new developer get access to it?
Are there any staging or pre-production environments that developers can use?
What are the various pieces that the fully deployed software uses? For example, with Heroku, what addons does the app use?
Is continuous integration or continuous deployment enabled? If so, where does it live?

# Technologies used

#### React
The React app is stored within the `/client` folder
#### Node.js and Express
This can be found within the `index.js` file
#### PostgresQL and Heroku
