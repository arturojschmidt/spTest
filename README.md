A tweet-sized (280 characters max) summary of why the project exists.

# Getting started

### Running the React App
#### Prerequisites: 
what other software needs to be installed before developing or running this software (e.g. Node.js)? Give specific commands to install the software, noting any assumptions about package management tools or operating system.
#### Installing: 
how can a user get a working development environment? Give step-by-step instructions.
#### Running locally: 
once everything is installed, how can a user start a local server?
Warranty: when (in terms of date or commit) were these instructions last tested and verified to work, by whom, and on what operating system?

# Testing

How can the user run the test suite? Give specific commands.
Any other test-related commands to know about, e.g. a different command for unit tests vs. integration tests?

# Deployment

Where does the production system live? How would a new developer get access to it?
Are there any staging or pre-production environments that developers can use?
What are the various pieces that the fully deployed software uses? For example, with Heroku, what addons does the app use?
Is continuous integration or continuous deployment enabled? If so, where does it live?

# Technologies used

#### React
The React app is stored within the /client folder
#### Node.js and Express
This can be found within the index.js file
#### PostgresQL and Heroku
Heroku is used for hosting the web application and the PostgresQL database.
